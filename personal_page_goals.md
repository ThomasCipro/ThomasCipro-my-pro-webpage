## Map
#### The site will contain a welcome page that will contain artwork that is significant to me personally or to my current project. A navigation bar will sit at the top of the page with the following options. First, an "About Me" page will provide a short bio profile and link to my resume/CV. The bio profile will include cursory information, including educational background, research interests, and personal interests. Second, there will be a "Projects" page that will detail completed projects by providing gengeral descriptions and key results of said projects. There will also be a "Contact Me" page that includes important contact information such as a professional email, possibly a phone number, and any relevant professional profiles (i.e., LinkedIn).
