## Map
#### The site will contain a welcome page that will contain artwork that is significant to me personally or to my current project. A navigation bar will sit at the top of the page with the following options. First, an "About Me" page will provide a short bio profile and link to my resume/CV. The bio profile will include cursory information, including educational background, research interests, and personal interests. Second, there will be a "Projects" page that will detail completed projects by providing gengeral descriptions and key results of said projects. There will also be a "Contact Me" page that includes important contact information such as a professional email, possibly a phone number, and any relevant professional profiles (i.e., LinkedIn). 

## Thought Process
#### In my vision, a professional website is meant to do two things. First and foremost, it is supposed to facilitate connections by providing contact information and information on relevant work so that people can easily see if connecting with you is worth their time. Second, it is supposed to convey some sort of view into who you are as a person. Of course, aesthetics and layout design are important becuase they betray some aspect of your personality. A bit of show and not tell, if you will. I believe that this vague layout will help accomplist these goals.
