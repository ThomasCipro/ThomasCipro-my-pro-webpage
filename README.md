# ThomasCipro-my-pro-webpage

### The purpose of this particular repo is to display my professional webpage. Additionally, it will catalog the websites that served as inspiration for my webpage, the changes made to the intent/purpose of said webpage as it develops, and its various incarnations. 
### I included two sites in my research file. They are the official websites for the indie-folk band CAAMP and "Explore Parts Unkown," a site dedicated to Anthony Bourdain's memory and legacy as a travel and food writer. I believe both sites offer inspiration for layout, design, aesthetic standards, and offer different visions. Ultimately, I wish to emulate aspects of both sites when building my own.
